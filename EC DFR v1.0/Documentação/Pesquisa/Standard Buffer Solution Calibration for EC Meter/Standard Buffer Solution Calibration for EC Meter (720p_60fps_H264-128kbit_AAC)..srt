00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Today, we'll demonstrate how to calibrate the DFRobot electrical conductivity meter (EC meter)

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:17,000
First, we need to upload the calibration sketch to the Arduino board.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,000
This sketch is used for the calibration and normal use

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
This is the code "EC Calibration"

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Sketches and connection diagrams will be released on the product wiki page later

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:57,000
EC meter connects to "A1" and DS18B20 temperature sensor connects to "D2"

8
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Select the right Arduino board and right COM port

9
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Oooops, looking for the right COM port...

10
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
OK Got it.

11
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Now upload the sketch...

12
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Now, open the serial monitor

13
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Select "115200" and "Both NL &amp; CR"

14
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Plug the probe in the 12.88 conductivity solution, if everything goes well, you will see the data in the serial monitor

15
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:30,500
If you find the value incorrect, you can make a calibration

16
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:49,439
Send "Calibration" to the serial port, and you'll enter Calibration mode

17
00:02:49,439 --> 00:03:05,000
Enter "Confirm" to confirm the calibration result

18
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Enter "exit" to exit "Calibration Mode"

19
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:33,039
